				<p style="text-align:justify">I'm currently working as a Senior Cyber Security Engineer at <a href="http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/" target="_blank">Johnson Controls</a>, where I specialize in Product Security and Enterprise Application Security. I report to the Director of Global Product Security, Technical Services division, where
I lead the ongoing development and operation of an automated Red Teaming ecosystem for the Global Product Security Technical Services team - a best-in-class scalable system for internal security assessment and pen-testing capabilities, applied to various product lines at JCI.</p>                                       
				<p style="text-align:justify">I was previously a Post-Doctoral Researcher (Cyber Security) at the <a href="https://www.ucc.ie/en/misl/" target="_blank">Mobile and Internet Systems Labratory (MISL)</a>, <a href="https://www.ucc.ie/en/compsci/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://www.ucc.ie/en/" target="_blank">University College Cork (UCC)</a>, Ireland. I worked as part of the <a href="http://www.chistera.eu/" target="_blank">CHIST-ERA</a> <a href="https://dyposit.eu/" target="_blank">DYPOSIT</a> project. My research was directed by <a href="https://simonnfoley.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Simon Foley</a>, and focused primarily on autonomic security control reconfiguration, and the problem of large, shared Cyber-Physical System infrastructures under attack. </p>                                       
				<p style="text-align:justify">I have served as a nominated peer-reviewer of scientific publications for the <a href="http://conf.laas.fr/esorics/" target="_blank">European Symposium on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS)</a>.  </p>                                       
				<p style="text-align:justify">I succeeded in my viva voce defence at the Department of Computer Science in UCC for a Ph.D. in reasoning about anomaly-free policy
management for network and host-based access control mechanisms in May 2017. I also hold an M.Sc. in Software and Systems for Mobile Networks, and a B.Sc. (Hons.) in Computer Science, both awarded from University College Cork.</p>                 
				<p style="text-align:justify">My current research interests include autonomic security control reconfiguration, dynamic policy frameworks, network and host-based access controls, mobile security, cloud security, cyber-physical security and mathematics. </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify">My Erd&#337;s number is <a href="https://www.csauthors.net/distance/paul-erdos/ultan-neville" target="_blank">5</a> &#9786;</p>
